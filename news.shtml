       <p><small>June 1, 2015</small><br> A new release of the SMT-LIB
        benchmark library is available on StarExec.  Many old benchmarks that
        had status "unknown" now have updated statuses of either "sat" or
        "unsat".  A number of new benchmarks have also been added, both
        incremental and non-incremental.  Incremental divisions with new
        benchmarks are: ALIA, ANIA, LIA, QF_ALIA, QF_ANIA, QF_LIA, QF_NIA, and
        QF_UFNIA.  Non-incremental divisions with new benchmarks are: LIA, NIA,
        QF_ALIA, QF_AUFNIA, QF_LIRA, QF_NIA, QF_NIRA, UFBV, UFLIA, and UFNIA.
        Benchmarks can be downloaded directly from StarExec or from a mirror at
        <a href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~barrett/smtlib/">NYU</a>.

       <p><small>May 28, 2015</small><br>
        Version 2.5 of the SMT-LIB standard is out!
        It is an extension of Version 2.0 and, with two minor exceptions, it is fully backward compatible with that previous version.
        See the <a href="language.shtml">Language</a> section for the reference document.
       </p>
       <a name="2014-06-11"></a>
       <p><small>June 11, 2014</small><br>
        For bulk downloads, zip archives containing section of the latest release of the repository (2014-06-03) are also available. See the <a href="benchmarks.shtml">Benchmarks</a> section for further instructions.
       </p>
       <a name="2014-06-04"></a>
       <p><small>June 4, 2014</small><br>
        The migration of the benchmark repository to the StarExec service is now complete. See the <a href="benchmarks.shtml">Benchmarks</a> section for instructions on how to access the repository.<br>
        The current release, 2014-06-03, has been considerably expanded with new logics and thousands of new benchmarks.
        We have also created a few new logics that best describe some sets of benchmarks. As a consequence, a number of old benchmarks have been reclassified accordingly logic-wise.
       </p>
       <p><small>June 4, 2014</small><br>
        We have added a graph in the <a href="logics.shtml">Logics</a> section that illustrates the containment relation between the various SMT-LIB logics.
       </p>
       <p><small>May 24, 2014</small><br>
        A theory of floating point numbers, called <code>FloatingPoint</code>, has
        been added to the Theories section.
       </p>
       <p><small>May 24, 2014</small><br>
        A new, completely revamped web site went live today.
       </p>
       <p><small>June 26, 2013</small><br>
        A <code>:value</code> attribute has been defined for the theory <code>FixedSizedBitvectors</code>.
       </p>
       <p><small>June 26, 2013</small><br>
        The theory <code>Fixed_Sized_Bitvectors</code> has been renamed <code>FixedSizedBitvectors</code>, for naming consistency. The logic declarations that refer to that theory have been updated accordingly.
       </p>
       <p><small>September 9, 2012</small><br>
        A new release of the reference of the Version 2.0 reference document has been posted in the Documents section. It contains a few minor fixes and a clarification on the language of a logic.
       </p>
       <p><small>June 14, 2011</small><br>
        The definition of bvsmod in the <code>QF_BV</code> logic has been updated to correct a bug (the definition was incorrect in case the divisor is negative and the dividend is a multiple of the divisor).
       </p>
       <p><small>June 11, 2011</small><br>
        The declarations for the following logics have been added in the Logics section: <code>QF_NRA</code>, <code>QF_UFBV</code>, <code>QF_UFLIA</code>, <code>QF_UF<code>LRA</code>, <code>QF_UF</code>NRA</code>, <code>UFLRA</code>, <code>UFNIA</code>. A couple of them are new. The rest had had benchmarks in the library for a while but their declaration was missing.
       </p>
       <p><small>June 03, 2011</small><br>
        Fixed an error in the declaration of all the logics including the <code>Reals</code> theory (the definition of coefficient in the <code>:extension</code> attribute was missing a case).
       </p>
       <p><small>June 03, 2011</small><br>
        Added a note to the declaration of <code>QF_UFIDL</code>.
       </p>
       <p><small>June 03, 2011</small><br>
        Extended the definition of linear term in the <code>:extension</code> attribute of <code>QF_AUFLIA</code>.
       </p>
       <p><small>January 18, 2011</small><br>
        Links to a set of Java utilities for SMT-LIB 2 scripts has been added in the Utilities section.
       </p>

        A tutorial, by D. Cok, on the SMT-LIB 2 format has been added in the Documents section.
       </p>
       <p><small>December 21, 2010</small><br>
        A new release of the Version 2.0 reference document has been posted in the Documents section. This is another minor release, fixing a number errors, clarifying the text in a few points, and adjusting the standard in minor ways.
       </p>
       <p><small>September 1, 2010</small><br>
        Section Utilities has been revamped, with the addition of two parsers for SMT-LIB 2.
       </p>
       <p><small>August 28, 2010</small><br>
        A new release of the Version 2.0 reference document has been posted in the Documents section. This is a minor release, fixing a number errors, clarifying the text in a few points, and adjusting the standard in minor ways.
       </p>
       <p><small>May 4, 2010</small><br>
        An initial version of the benchmark repository in the SMT-LIB 2.0 format is now available in the Benchmarks section. Conformance checking is still ongoing, and these benchmarks may be changed to conform to the SMT-LIB 2.0 format.
       </p>
       <p><small>May 1, 2010</small><br>
        A number of theory and logic declarations have been converted from Version 1.2 to Version 2.0 of the SMT-LIB format. They are available in the Theories and Benchmarks sections. More theories and logic declarations will be added in the next few days.
       </p>
       <p><small>March 30, 2010</small><br>
        Version 2.0 of the SMT-LIB format has been released. Its reference document, which supersedes all previous drafts, is now available from the Documents section.
       </p>
       <p><small>February 10, 2010</small><br>
        An updated, almost final draft of the Version 2.0 document is now available in the Documents section.
       </p>
       <p><small>February 1, 2010</small><br>
        A draft of the coming Version 2.0 of the SMT-LIB format is now available in the Documents section.
       </p>
       <p><small>August 18, 2009</small><br>
        A link to Robert Brummayer's SMT debugging utilities has been added in the Utilities section.
       </p>
       <p><small>July 4, 2009</small><br>
        The logic <code>LRA</code>, for (quantified) formulas in linear real arithmetic, has been added.
       </p>
       <p><small>July 2, 2009</small><br>
        Updates and additions to the new 2009 benchmarks have been posted to the SMT-LIB benchmark page. No new benchmarks will be added before SMT-COMP 2009. These benchmarks are in the process of being integrated with the SMT-LIB.
       </p>
       <p><small>June 25, 2009</small><br>
        Three new logics have been added, all having to do with non-linear arithmetic: <code>QF_NIA</code>, <code>QF_UFNRA</code> and <code>UFNIA</code>.
       </p>
       <p><small>June 3, 2009</small><br>
        New benchmarks for 2009 have been posted to the SMT-LIB benchmark page. These benchmarks are in the process of being integrated with the SMT-LIB.
       </p>
       <p><small>June 5, 2008</small><br>
        <code>QF_BV</code>/spear benchmarks were missing the ":formula" attribute. ":formula true" has been added to all of these benchmarks.
       </p>
       <p><small>June 1, 2008</small><br>
        Status and difficulty updates have been done across all benchmarks. Also, 1485 benchmarks were moved from <code>QF_AUFLIA</code> to <code>QF_AX</code>. These benchmarks do not use uninterpreted functions or arithmetic in any meaningful way. The only change needed was to change the sorts from Int to Index/Element in order to fit within the <code>QF_AX</code> logic. Fixed a typo in <code>QF_AUFBV</code>: brummaryerbiere -> brummayerbiere.
       </p>
       <p><small>May 21, 2008</small><br>
        An additional 415 benchmarks have been added to <code>QF_BV</code> in subdirectories uclid/catchconv (the 1 existing benchmark was moved here) and uclid/tcas.
       </p>
       <p><small>May 20, 2008</small><br>
        A total of 66 new benchmarks have been added to <code>QF_BV</code>: 65 in brummayerbiere2 and 1 in uclid.
        Minor fixes have been made in <code>QF_UF/eq_diamond</code> and <code>QF_BV/brummayerbiere</code>.
        The <code>UFNIA</code> benchmarks have been added as "pending".
       </p>
       <p><small>May 1, 2008</small><br>
        A total of 935 new benchmarks have been added.
        <code>QF_AUFBV</code> : 293 in brummayerbiere;
        <code>QF_BV</code>      : 13 in brummayerbiere;
        <code>QF_IDL</code>     : 280 in schedulingIDL;
        <code>QF_LIA</code>     : 294 in rings;

        The new bitvector theories and logics have been posted. Also, a total of 2011 new benchmarks have been added to <code>QF_BV</code> and 8168 new benchmakrs have been added to <code>QF_AUFBV</code>. Some of these have been retranslated from <code>QF_UFBV </code>32. The rest are from various sources and make use of the new theories and logics.
       </p>
       <p><small>May 17, 2007</small><br>
        A set of sample benchmarks have been added to <code>QF_BV</code> and <code>QF_AUFBV</code>.
       </p>
       <p><small>May 08, 2007</small><br>
        A total of 3603 new benchmarks have been added to the set of <code>AUFLIA</code> benchmarks. These are translations of the boogie benchmarks (see http://research.microsoft.com/specsharp/) and an alternative and more complete translation of the simplify benchmarks (in subdirectory simplify2). These were translated by Michal Moskal.
       </p>
       <p><small>May 1, 2007</small><br>
        A total of 1325 new benchmarks have been added to the set of <code>AUFLIRA</code>benchmarks. These are translations of the Caduceus benchmarks provided by Claude Marche using the Why verifiction tool. See http://proval.lri.fr/why-benchmarks.
       </p>
       <p><small>Movember 20, 2006</small><br>
        A total of 6404 new benchmarks have been added to the set of <code>QF_UF</code> benchmarks. These were provided by Volker Sorge and are based on classification of quasi-groups.
       </p>
       <p><small>November 19, 2006</small><br>
        Most of the RTCL benchmarks were moved from <code>QF_LIA</code> to <code>QF_UFIDL</code> because they are a better fit for difference logic than linear arithmetic.
       </p>
       <p><small>November 19, 2006</small><br>
        Some slight modifications were made to a number of the other <code>QF_UFIDL</code> benchmarks to eliminate the use of constructs that technically are not allowed by this logic.
