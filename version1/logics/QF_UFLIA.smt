 "Closed quantifier-free formulas built over an arbitrary expansion of 
  the Ints signature with free sort, function, and/or predicate symbols 
  but containing only linear atoms, that is, atoms with no occurrences
  of the function symbol * (but see the notational conventions below).

  Formulas in ite terms must satisfy the same restriction, with the 
  exception that they need not be closed.
